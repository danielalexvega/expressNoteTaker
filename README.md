## Description

Note Taker helps you keep track of your notes, and it's pretty straight forward. With a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend and Node.js and Express on the back end, your notes are stored in a JSON file and will still be there after you refresh the page. You can also click on notes to edit any old notes. 

###Tech

Note Taker users a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [jQuery] - duh

### Using Note Taker
When open the page, just click on 'Get Started' to go to the Notes page. 

If you have no notes saved, then you can just start right away. Or you can click the pencil in the top right corner. 


As you start typing, a save button should appear next to the pencil. Click on that to save your file. 

If you want to see a previous note, just click on that note on the left hand column. Then the note will appear, and if you wish to edit it, 
just keep typing where you left off, but make sure you save again. 

Enjoy!
